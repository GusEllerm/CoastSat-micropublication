# CoastSat Micropublication

This project explores the integration of LivePublication micropublications with [CoastSat](https://github.com/UoA-eResearch/CoastSat). The goal is to generate procedural, data-driven micropublications for individual coastal transects and link them interactively to a map-based interface powered by `leaflet.glify`.

## Project Structure

- `CoastSat/`: Submodule containing a fork of the [CoastSat](https://github.com/UoA-eResearch/CoastSat) repo, with a branch used for micropublication integration with its `leaflet.glify` map.
- `publication.crate/`: Self-contained, executable RO-Crate generating [Stencila](https://stenci.la/) micropublciations dependent on the  `interface.crate`
- `publication.crate/interface.crate/`: Models the computational processes, data, and results generated by the current version of the [CoastSat experiement](https://github.com/UoA-eResearch/CoastSat).

## Publication.crate Generation

The publication crate is generated with the `publication_crate.py` script. This script packages two primary components (alongside the `interface.crate` and other descriptive metadatas):

- `micropublication.smd` -- the template used to generate the micropublication dependent on `interface.crate` data
- `micropublication_logic.py` -- the logic used to compile the `micropublication.smd` for a specific transect. This script takes two arguments: `--transect_id` (the id of the desired transect to be used), and `--output` (the output directory for the micropublication).
